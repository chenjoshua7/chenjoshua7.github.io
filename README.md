# My Portfolio

I wanted to be able to organize and present the projects and assignments that I have been working in an organized way. I am not a web developer by any stretch of the imagination. However, in middle school, I did really enjoy creating simple HTML webpages instead of PowerPoints for my presentations. Therefore, I decided to give a webpage a shot. After trying a number of things, I decided the easiest thing was to brush off my HTML knowledge and create a simple webpage from scratch. Enjoy the webpage!
